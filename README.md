# Driver-drowsiness-detection-and-prediction-system
# Background:
Drowsiness is one of the underlying causes of driving accidents, which
contribute, to many road fatalities annually. Although numerous methods have been
developed to detect the level of drowsiness, techniques based on image processing
are quicker and more accurate in comparison with the other methods. The aim of
this study was to use image-processing techniques to detect the levels of drowsiness
in a driving simulator.
# Methods:
The facial expressions, as well as location of the eyes, were detected by
Violla-Jones algorithm. Criteria for detecting drivers’ levels of drowsiness by eyes
tracking included eye blink duration blink frequency and PERCLOS that was used to
confirm the results.
# Results:
Eye closure duration and blink frequency have a direct ratio of drivers’ levels of drowsiness. The mean of squares of errors for data trained by the network and
data into the network for testing, were 0.0623 and 0.0700, respectively. Meanwhile,
the percentage of accuracy of detecting system was 93.
# Conclusion: 
The results showed several dynamic changes of the eyes during the
periods of drowsiness. The present study proposes a fast and accurate method for
detecting the levels of drivers’ drowsiness by considering the dynamic changes of the
eyes.
